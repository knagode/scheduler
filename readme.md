- validate lesson creation (can lesson actually be created on specific date)
- display error if two users wants to book a lesson
- consider caching on slow operations (whenever we use bookable_slot) and delete cache per teacher
- completely remove check_for_user_change section in application_controller
- controller based check if user (teacher of student) can delete a lesson
